This is the EC327 Project Submission for Team Helpless Avocado

The Team Members are :
	Luca Giudi
	Linglong Le
	Alexander Mackanic
	Aidan McCall
	
For this Project, 2 External Libraries are required:
	OpenCV 3.4.12 which can be found here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/files/3.4.12/opencv-3.4.12-android-sdk.zip/download
	Jencode, which can be found here:
	
Jencode was not altered in any way, but in OpenCV 3.4.12 the functions JavaCameraView.java and CameraBridgeViewBase.java found within this library 
were altered for this project, and have been included within this .zip submission.

To run this project simply extract this zip file to any location on your computer.
Then open up Android studio, and select import project, before navigating to the folder that the contents were unzipped to.
Select that folder for import, and allow it to import.

OpenCV has already been integrated into the project, and the majority of the Size of the Zip file. However, Jencode must be installed 
and integrated into the library for the Video Funcitons to work.
